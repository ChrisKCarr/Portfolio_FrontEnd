# Personal Portfolio

Portfolio site with a login feature - to be used by me only - where I can keep track and display my resume, projects, and skills I have accumulated.

## Unsolved Problems

I'm proud to say that for most people the experience on the site will be bug free, however I still would like to work on optimizing certain pages on the site. Just testing it on the different devices with my family it works on both desktop and mobile, the Resume iframe can seem cut off on certain mobile displays though, so I will work on correcting this when I find time.

## Future Plans

- There were many features I wanted to add for this project, but due to the time limit was unable to. Some of these were: an organizer on the private end, a private calander, and a code study section for myself. 
- The key feature I will work on adding as soon as possible will be to have an image of my project displayed as the background to the project <div>.
